Hi there!
It seems that you want to use **SharpAvi** or to find out whether it suits your needs.
Below are several articles that should provide you an easy start. 

[Getting Started](getting-started.md)

[Using Video Encoders](using-video-encoders.md)

[Working with Audio Streams](working-with-audio-streams.md)

[Asynchronous Writing](asynchronous-writing.md)

A public surface of the API is covered with XML documentation comments. Source code also includes a sample screen capturing application. Hope this all helps :)

> :bulb: **Tip.** For documentation on **the older v2** [navigate here](v2/index.md).
